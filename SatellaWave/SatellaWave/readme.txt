SatellaWave 0.1 (2017-12-29)
by LuigiBlood

This software can make Satellaview compatible server binary files.
A tree of channels is managed by the user and it is possible to save, then load a repository of channels with all their attributes.
You can then export to binary files compatible with SNES emulators that supports them.

As of this time of writing, the SNES emulators that supports such files are:
- bsnes-plus v073+3 and later (in bsxdat folder)
- SNES9X 1.55 and later (in SatData folder)

However, the bigger files to be downloaded are only supported in development versions from LuigiBlood, so you may have to compile those versions yourself (repositories can be found at https://github.com/LuigiBlood).

Currently supported channels:
- Message Channel
- Town Status
- Directory
	- Folders
		- Files (also Include Files)
		- Items
- Time Channel (BS-X)
- Time Channel (Game Specific)
- Shigesato Itoi no Bass Fishing No. 1 Contest Channels
